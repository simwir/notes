    \item[Update] functions are activated by a problem-domain event and result in a change in the model's state.
    \item[Signal] functions are activated by a change in the model's state and result in a reaction in the context; this reaction might be a display to the actors in the application domain, or a direct intervention in the problem domain.
    \item[Read] functions are activated by a need for information in an actor's work task and result in the system displaying relevant parts of the model.
    \item[Compute] functions are activated by a need for information in an actor's work task and consist of a computation involving information provided by the actor or the model; the result is a display of the computation's result.
