To show that a loop invariant holds 3 things must be true:\textit{(CLRS page 19)}
\begin{description}
	\item[Initialization] It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
	\item[Maintenance] If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.
	\item[Termination] When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.
\end{description}
